<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Augustus Fitz-Herbert</span>, as all are aware,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Having crossed the Atlantic, and got a moustache on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise being son of a known millionaire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stands of course on the very top round of the fashion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being taught to consider himself, from his birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one of the privileged ones of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cherishes deep and befitting disdain<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i2">For those who don't live in the Fifth Avenue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As entirely unworthy the notice or thought<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the heir of two millions and nothing to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls them canaille, which I'm credibly told<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is the only French word which he caught when away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though, in my case, if I might be so bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I should say it scarce paid one for half a year's stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heir of two millions and nothing to do,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who lives in a palace in Fifth Avenue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As a matter of course, is no fitting comparison<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the heir of an inkstand and something to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who lodges up stairs, in the house of Miss Harrison.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In this model republic, this land of the free&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So our orators call it, and why should not we?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis refreshing to know that without pedigree<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A man may still climb to the top of the tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That questions of family, rank, and high birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bow to the query, How much is he worth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That John Smith, plebeian, who forty years since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked Broadway barefooted, now rides as a prince;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having managed, though not overburdened with wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But rather by chance and a fortunate hit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take a high place on Society's rounds;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His claims being based on pence, shillings, and pounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I admit there's a certain republican merit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In making the fortune which others inherit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why should John Smith so completely ignore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bridge which has brought him triumphantly o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn with disgust from the opposite shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why, when Miranda, whose heart is not proof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against Cupid's sharp arrows, some day leaves his roof,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, sundering her family-ties at a jerk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returns in the evening&mdash;the wife of his clerk!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus at Love's trumpet-call bidding Duty defiance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should he strive to break up the clandestine alliance?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though men have made money, and will do again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was never a case known where money made men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if Jones be a man in what constitutes manhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's a far better match than young Frederic Stanwood,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though the one be a clerk, and the other the heir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the house next M'Flimsey's, on Madison-square.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the one is deficient in wealth, we may find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other quite bankrupt in morals and mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Excuse this digression, which yet is germain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the subject in hand, as will be very plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I say that Fitz-Herbert's respected progenitor<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Did business years since, as I'm told, in a den eight or<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten feet each way, where he daily had calls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From all sorts of people with all sorts of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From coats and umbrellas to bracelets and rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be left, until claimed, at the Three Golden Balls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, long emerged from his chrysalis state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should his former acquaintances call at his gate,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They would doubtless receive speedy notice to leave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the articles brought, but the dwelling instanter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their pace perhaps changed to a very quick canter.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So changes the world, and the men that are in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That those whom we hail as our equals, one minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pass by the next with a very cold stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gruffly inquire who the d&mdash;ickens they are.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From the past to the present&mdash;to close our review&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pawnbroker's shop to the Fifth Avenue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the parlors so full of <i>objets de vertu</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And furniture most undeniably new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where on tapestry carpets the foot softly falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And family portraits look down from the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of martial old grandsires and stately old dames;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, bought cheap at auction, and set in new frames,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And dubbed with high-sounding and fanciful names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At peace after many of Fortune's mutations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look impressively down on their new-found relations.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's Sir Arthur Fitz-Herbert, an old English knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who won his gold spurs in a hardly-fought field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he rescued the life of the gallant Black Prince<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By receiving a blow meant for him&mdash;on his shield;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of which glorious action, so well worth attention,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a single historian makes any mention;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though by family documents amply attested,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In possession of those who are most interested.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there's Lady Fitz-Herbert&mdash;a Queen's maid of honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who spent her chief time in attendance upon her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Queen left on a visit to Calais,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remained in sole charge of&mdash;the plate and the palace.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">All which, the Fitz-Herberts may justly lay claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invests with proud honor the family name.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is something that puzzles me, let me confess&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why these rare old antiques wear so modern a dress!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless, like the comet which now reappears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first time, I think, within hundreds of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fashions in dress run through regular courses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strictly obey the mechanical forces.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Let me hereby suggest that some almanac-maker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his very next issue but one, undertake a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief record of Fashions that may reäppear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the course of the next or the following year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what eager eyes would our wives read, be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About&mdash;this&mdash;time&mdash;expect&mdash;a&mdash;new&mdash;style&mdash;of&mdash;coiffure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A black lace Fichu under dark satin loops;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, more ominous still, a recurrence of hoops!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attended, perhaps, by the brief intimation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Based upon strict and exact calculation,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That the first would enjoy but a limited reign, as<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was looked for next year in far-distant Uranus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the last had intended to visit us sooner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tarried a while with the ladies of Luna.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Apropos of the portraits&mdash;I've heard of a queer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contretemps which befell the most famous last year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean of Sir Arthur, who saved the Black Prince,&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Excuse my not knowing how many years since.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems a young lady&mdash;Miss Blanche Delarue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day on a visit to Fifth Avenue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While carelessly chatting and sipping some sherbet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was shown the fine portrait of Arthur Fitz-Herbert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, Augustus assured her, as an heirloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was more valued than anything else in the room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proceeded to speak of the well-deserved fame<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sir Arthur Fitz-Herbert, the first of his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a few of those actions of gallant emprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which have made him so great in Posterity's eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, at least, that small part which, like Miss Delarue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are on visiting terms in the Fifth Avenue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of his story conceive his amaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his visitor, after a long, earnest gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the portrait before her, approaching, let fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the tapestry carpet plate, sherbet, and all,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which, scattered with fragments of fine porcelain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must have suffered, I fear, an indelible stain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While standing aghast at a breach of propriety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rarely occurs in the best of society,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was startled still more, as I cannot but own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the lady exclaimed, in a deeply-moved tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In reply to his feebly-expressed "Never mind it,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's my grandfather's portrait! O, where did you find it?"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which indeed was the case, being sold at vendue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some years since, when the father of Blanche Delarue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lost for the time both his wealth and high station,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By indulging too largely in land speculation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unlucky portrait, I scarcely need say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was at once taken down, but soon after replaced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By another as stately, though somewhat defaced,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clear mark of age, and which, by the way,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<span class="i0">On Fitz-Herbert's assurance I'm glad to be able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say was a knight of the Famous Round Table.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If my memory fails not, 'tis three months to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Augustus Fitz-Herbert appeared in Broadway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having passed the last year in a tour beyond seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where his travels extended from Russia to Spain,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And towards the North-West from the famed Hebrides<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the beautiful isles in the fair Grecian main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has wandered through climes of which even the names<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thrill the heart with emotion, or summon a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we think how completely has time swept away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The traces of all that we fain would revere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has stood, it may be, on the very same spot<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Where Homer recited his deathless heroics,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or paused at the portico, knowing it not,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Zeno addressed his disciples, the Stoics.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance when he gazed from the brow of the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the once famous harbor&mdash;the Attic Piræus,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud trophy of valor reverse could not chill!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His foot pressed the turf on the breast of Musæus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has seen the proud city whose arts and whose arms<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<span class="i2">In the mouth of tradition for ages have rung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, there is not a foot of that soil but has charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Tully once fulmined, where Virgil once sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the streets of Byzantium he's smoked a chibouk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the bearded and turbaned devout Mameluke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has seen the Cathedral&mdash;the glory of Munich&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deciphered inscriptions, <i>perhaps</i>, from the Runic;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Floated dreamily down the thrice beautiful Rhine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through lands that are teeming with olives and wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed a night in the capital city of Berne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crossed in a steamer the Lake of Lucerne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has strolled through the fortified town of Brussels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard in old Bruges the sweet Minster bells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has stopped in the siege-renowned city of Prague,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And supped with Mynheer in his town of the Hague;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At length reaching France, in a steamboat crossed over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troublesome straits linking Calais with Dover;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gained, up to London he travelled post-haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the prominent thought, there was no time to waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the help of post-horses and frequent relays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He "did" the whole island in eight or ten days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During which he no doubt made a thorough survey<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of all objects of interest passed on the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He next made a very brief visit to Cork<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(The city and people he couldn't endure),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And returning took passage at once to New York,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the comforting thought&mdash;he had made the grand tour.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From his journal I venture below to record<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single impression received while abroad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"June 7th, we reached Athens&mdash;a sizable place,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Some three or four miles from the Gulf of Ægina;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It contains a cathedral not equal to Grace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Church in New York, which I think is much finer.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
